# üêã Pods & Voting

At SpiritDAO, we organize ourselves into ‚Äúpods.‚Äù A pod is a small working group with an independent budget and operations framework control.&#x20;

All pods form through the submission of a formal proposal. Pods may be indefinite or started to complete a specific task or sprint.

Members who direct their focus and energy towards SpiritDAO earn merit through contribution. This results in increased voting weight applied toward specific proposals.&#x20;

All of this and more is possible because we leverage digital membership tokens. If this sounds technical, don‚Äôt worry. Our Onboarding Pod walks new members through each step of the process.

We provide ample opportunities to learn, upskill, and contribute towards our shared mission and purpose. Members are free to join existing initiatives and imagine alternatives.
