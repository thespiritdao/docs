<summary>Reputation &#x26; Accreditation</summary>

SpiritDAO members earn merit through their contributions to the DAO and community. Presently we're leveraging Hats Protocol to assign merit to unique, non-transferable membership NFTs.&#x20;

Today we are presently leveraging merit as a means of voice and vote amplification within the community. However, this is an experimental technology with plenty of room to expand. Whatever trajectories we take, our community of Verified Members will determine the ideal courses of action.
