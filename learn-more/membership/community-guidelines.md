<summary>Violations and Consequences</summary>

Community Members will follow the guidelines listed below in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of the Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction Community Impact:** A single use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unwelcome in the community.&#x20;
   1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Consequence**</mark>: Deletion or removal of the post in question, in addition to communicating which rule was violated and how to avoid such violations in the future. If the action was in person, directly communicate with that individual to identify which rule was violated and how to avoid such violations.
2. **Warning Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.&#x20;
   1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Consequence**</mark>: A warning with consequences for continued inappropriate behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Community Forum, etc. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.
3. **Temporary Ban Community Impact:** A severe violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.&#x20;
   1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Consequence**</mark>: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the Community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
4. **Permanent Ban Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. Vote-selling or vote-renting classifies for a permanent ban.&#x20;
   1. <mark style="color:orange;">Consequence</mark>: Permanent removal from any interaction or public communication with the Community for a specified period. If an individual has alternate accounts, those may be removed as well. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed.

<summary>Reporting &#x26; Enforcement</summary>

Every community member has a duty to promote the use of the Community Guidelines, call to attention members of the community who come close to or violate the Guidelines (as long as this doesnâ€™t put their personal safety in jeopardy), and inform platform admins of violations. Ultimate responsibility for enforcing the Community Guidelines in each platform rests with the platform admins of each platform.&#x20;

To report a violation of the Community Guidelines, members can:&#x20;

* Tag a moderator in the platform where the violation has occurred,&#x20;
* Email the moderators at community@spiritdao.org
* Anonymously submit a report via: [<mark style="color:yellow;">https://forms.gle/EZoHJcdD1EWoFAkq5</mark>](https://forms.gle/EZoHJcdD1EWoFAkq5)
