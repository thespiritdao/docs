# ðŸŸ¡ $SELF Tokens

In a relational universe governed by the single truth, directing our focus and energy within a moment is an act of mutual becoming.&#x20;

At SpiritDAO, developing incentive and contribution mechanisms in alignment with our values is vital to the successful execution of our purposes. &#x20;

$SELF tokens are our inter-community exchange tokens.

$SELF tokens are time-bound and cannot be purchased. We earn them by directing our focus and energy toward SpiritDAO and SpiritDAO-related efforts.&#x20;

**Members exchange $SELF tokens for priority access to community resources, artifacts, events, memberships, and more.**&#x20;

$SELF tokens hold no value besides the value we collectively give them. They are a way for the community to reward itself and recognize member contributions.

Non-members cannot earn $SELF tokens.

$SELF tokens exist on the Optimism Chain â€” [Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xed034912584d0bcdefc396d27b641f4419cec865).
