SpiritDAO leverages the following tooling to empower community access and agency.

* [<mark style="color:yellow;">Unlock Protocol</mark> ](https://unlock-protocol.com/)- Time-limited, non-transferable membership tokens.
* [<mark style="color:yellow;">Charmverse</mark>](https://app.gitbook.com/o/fxiZtiQt1W8q8LpPAHyq/s/gauAUVhKqAYQuxgXC0AW/) - Collaboration / Operations (Forum/Votes/Wiki/Bounties/Member Directory/Calendar) &#x20;
* [<mark style="color:yellow;">Hats Protocol</mark> ](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/)- Hats supports a suite of customized tokens/keycards that serve to provide granular access and agency within the DAO and accrue merit over time. Supports the infrastructure for weighted voting.
* [<mark style="color:yellow;">Bonfire</mark>](https://www.bonfire.xyz/) - Bonfire is a token-gated video viewing platform where I can export the content watched (to the minute) of a specific wallet holding the token. Important in that it lets us verify that they completed the video.
* [<mark style="color:yellow;">Guild.xyz</mark>](http://guild.xyz/) - Token gates our [<mark style="color:yellow;">Community Discord</mark>](https://discord.gg/Dg94YJxAEm) + Assigns roles chosen during onboarding. Also gates our google docs.
* [<mark style="color:yellow;">Snapshot</mark> ](https://snapshot.org/#/spiritdao.eth)- Snapshot is off-chain voting by wallet (and supports weighted voting w/ hats). Most DAOs today conduct most activity off chain and then commit transactions to a chain after consensus within the community. This is integrated with Charmverse so our users can operate in a single ecosystem.
* We run on the [<mark style="color:yellow;">Optimism Chain</mark>](https://www.optimism.io/) (Ethereum L2)
