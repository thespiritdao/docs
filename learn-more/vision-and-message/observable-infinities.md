# ♾️ Observable Infinities

There are two observable infinities within the universe.

* The Universe Itself
* Human Imagination

The alignment of these two represents human **divinity within the moment.**

We embrace this knowledge and apply it to our practice. In doing so, we become more godlike, fully expressing and expanding our powers.



**Self (noun):** The relationship between the individual and their circumstance within a given moment.&#x20;
