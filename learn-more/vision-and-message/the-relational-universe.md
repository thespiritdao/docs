# ðŸªž The Relational Universe

The relational universe expresses our understanding that no separate events exist in nature. Being is always momentary totalityâ€”a single happening.

The absolute unity of the individual observer and the universe itself is a well-established spiritual philosophy central to the Vedic, Hindu, and Buddhist philosophies. We are both inseparable from the other and simultaneously independent of them.&#x20;

**When we embrace oneness with the relational universe, we acknowledge our deep connection with the world around us.**&#x20;

Oneness with the relational universe isnâ€™t purely spiritual philosophy but the material reality of existence. Our scientific knowledge continues to expand upon how our thoughts, actions, observations, and creations ripple throughout the universeâ€”highlighting that the changing nature of time is a trend growing in parallel with the changing nature of humanity.&#x20;

**Today we understand that human observation changes the universe, committing probability to history and generating disorder.**

All systems reinforce specific ways of thinking and acting within the world, defining relationships with ourselves and others by forcing us to take on a particular shape. Our inhabiting a relational universe ensures that the direction of focus and energy in the moment is a mutual act of becoming.&#x20;

Our embrace of a relational universe governed by the single truth as a source of spiritual grounding demands a commitment to systemic actualization to recognize the divinity inherent in ourselves and others.&#x20;

We seek to maximize individual access and agency and free the latent imagination trapped in the world.
