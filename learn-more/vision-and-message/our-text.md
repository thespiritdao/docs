## [<mark style="color:yellow;">Self-actualization in the Age of Crisis</mark>](https://www.singletruth.org)

#### Originally authored by Ron Rivers

Cosmology and physics have revealed the single truth. It changes everything we think we know about the universe and demands a reimagination of how we organize our relationships with ourselves and others. Self-Actualization in the Age of Crisis binds spiritual renaissance to systemic reformation as a pathway toward shared transcendence.

In _<mark style="color:green;">**Self-Actualization in the Age of Crisis**</mark>_, you‚Äôll discover:&#x20;

* What cosmology and physics reveal about the nature of reality and what it means for humanity.\

* A detailed analysis of the multiple crises humanity struggles to overcome and what we must do to transcend them.\

* How the changing nature of time, single truth, relational universe, and observable infinities reframe spirituality and divinity.\

* A redefinition of self as it relates to individual and systemic actualization, including new core values to guide our everyday lives.\

* The Eight Dignities: A new set of systemic rights that further our alignment with the single truth and relational universe to fully recognize and honor our embodied infinity.\

* Frameworks of philosophy and practice you can embrace immediately to better align yourself with the nature of the universe as it is.\
