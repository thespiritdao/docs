# âš™ Eight Dignities

The eight dignities represent individual sacred rights in alignment with the single truth and relational universe. They are central to our spiritual practice and describe our current approach to systemic actualization.

Our advancement of the eight dignities frees the individual from the constraints of birth lottery as the primary determining factor of access and agency in life. Through collective progress, we most expansively elevate the individual to express their divinity in the moment.

SpiritDAO is an action-oriented community serving to further realize these global public works as one of our core purposes.&#x20;

We accomplish this through various methods, including capital support for DAOs and organizations working to develop public goods within the eight dignities, inter-community investment, product/service creation, and cross-pollinating membership with mission and value-aligned organizations.&#x20;
