### **We yearn to be more.**&#x20;

Living in an era of abundance where the majority struggle to meet their most basic needs.&#x20;

Crises surround us and our available vehicles for change resist it by design, but change is the single truth.&#x20;

The systems surrounding us prioritize birth lottery as the most important event of our lives. They fail to fully recognize and respect the divinity inherent in each of us.&#x20;

We have given our creations power over us, yet they fail to meet the needs of this moment.

They do not deserve this power. We are more than them.&#x20;

Our greatest struggle is not that weâ€™re here but have lacked other paths.

But what else is there, and where to begin?&#x20;

The only place we can â€” the end.
